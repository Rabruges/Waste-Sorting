# Waste Sorting with Deep Learning
A Deep Learning model was built to systematize the separation of organic waste in market places of Bogotá.

Waste sorting is an activity that is currently not carried out in a systematic way, therefore, it totally depends on human activity to be able to perform. Taking into account the new trends in Circular Economy and Deep Learning, a study was conducted where a methodology with Deep Learning models was implemented to systematize the separation of organic waste in market places. For this research, the Restrepo Market Place in the city of Bogotá DC was selected and organic waste corresponding to shells of peas, cape gooseberries, cobs and beans were used for the experiment. The proposed methodology includes the data collection (photos of each type of shell), the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Networks model and the evaluation of the model's predictive capacity. The results of this implementation show that the accuracy of the Convolutional Neural Network classifying these residues was 98.86%, showing that Deep Learning algorithms are robust to design solutions that can classify even more than the 4 proposed residuals, thus as scalable in systems that automate the classification of waste.
